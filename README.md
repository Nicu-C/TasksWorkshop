# TasksWorkshop

A simple Java console-based Task Manager that allows users to add, remove, list, and save tasks to a CSV file. This program provides a basic example of file handling, array manipulation, and user interaction through the console.

## How It Works

When the program starts, it loads all tasks from tasks.csv into memory.

The user is presented with four options:
Depending on the input:
`Please select an option: add remove list exit`


- add → Prompts for task details (description, due date, importance).

- remove → Lists tasks and asks which index to delete.

- list → Displays all tasks in a readable format.

- exit → Saves all tasks and quits the application.
